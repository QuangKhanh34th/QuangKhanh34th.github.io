    static is the default position
    fixed make the element stay at a fixed position even when we scroll the web,
    it also make the element stay on top of other elements and the below elements can take its space

    The position property has 4 special properties we can use to move the element around: top, bottom, left, right
    + top: specify how far away from the top that the element is placed, 0px is at the absolute top
    + left: specify how far away from the left that the element is placed

    If we use 2 opposite direction properties, the element will be stretched
    
    fixed position can cover the content, so we need to add spacing between the header and the content box
    one way to do this is by modify the spacing of the <body> tag

  -->
  <div style="
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    height: 50px;
    z-index: 1;

    ">header</div>

    <!--
      the header have a height of 50px so we will make the side bar 50px away from the top
      setting a fixed width so the side bar won't shrink we resizing the window
    -->
    <div style="
    background-color: green;
    color: white;
    position: fixed;
    left: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    top: 50px;
    width: 72px;
    z-index: 1;
    ">side bar
        <div style="
        position: absolute;
        background-color: red;
        color: white;
        top: 0;
        right: 0;
      ">
        X
      </div>
    </div>

    <!--
      absolute behave almost the same as fixed, but the key difference is
      + for elements with fixed position, they are placed in the "browser window"
      + for elements with absolute position, they are placed ON the "page"

      when we scroll the browser window, the the visible part of the web changes
      depend on if we scroll left or right, up or down. That is the "page" scrolling.
      so  elements with fixed position are placed in the "browser window" mean they will alway
      be visible and in the same position no matter which direction you scroll

      when a absolute element is placed inside a fixed element, its position will be
      relative to the fixed element

    -->
    <div style="
      position: absolute;
      background-color: red;
      color: white;
      right: 0;

      absolute

  <div style="
    background-color: lightblue;
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    ">
    div 1
  </div>

  <!--
    relative elements behave like static (or default) elements, except that any
    absolute elements placed inside them will have their position relate to the relative element,
    just like how it did with fixed elements

    this make absolute useful for things you want to be placed on top of other
    elements like number of notifications, duration of a video
